# 🧠 Shadow Monarch's Code Review

Welcome to **Shadow Monarch's Code Review** — a smart code review tool I built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), with a unique twist inspired by the *Solo Leveling* anime!

This project uses **Google Gemini AI** to give you instant feedback on your code. Whether you’re fixing bugs or just want to write better code, this tool helps you out like a coding buddy!

Let me know if you want a step-by-step setup guide or want me to explain any part more simply. Would you like me to continue writing the rest of the README (like how to run it, contact info, etc.) in the same friendly tone?
